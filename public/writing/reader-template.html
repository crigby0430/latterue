            <p>Hun wasn't sure how long it had been since he'd ended up wherever it was that he lived now. It had taken time to get used to how small his world was, in some ways, but he didn't mind. He didn't need to wait for nightfall to go out sailing; he had a place to sleep and plenty of food. He could count all his neighbors on one hand, and—aside from the one obvious exception—they seemed to like him well enough, for reasons he didn't understand but knew better than to question. Not much changed other than the weather and the rhythms of the sea.</p>
            <p>That was why he knew, when he looked up from the ocean floor and saw the shadow of another boat next to his own, that it must be some kind of omen. Probably not a good one.</p>
            <p>It couldn't have belonged to anyone else he knew. He quickly ruled out pirates—he hadn't seen a single one since arriving on the island, and the vessel was strangely shaped, hardly big enough for even a single passenger, let alone a whole crew. He put his tools in his belt, kicked off the seafloor, and swam towards it, cutting through the water at a cautious but steady pace. No sense in giving himself time to worry about whatever was going to happen. In the meantime, he focused on sizing up the vessel. It barely even looked seaworthy, he realized as he got closer. Really more of a raft.</p>
            <p>Hun braced himself and surfaced. Nothing happened, which was somehow worse. He frantically looked back and forth between the strange vessel and his own boat. The sides were just high enough that he couldn't see who or what was inside. They could be hiding.</p>
            <p>“Who's there?” he bellowed in his don't-fuck-with-me voice. No answer. The strange vessel bobbed inertly, not moving any closer or further away. Small waves broke against the flat sides, sending water onto the deck. He suddenly realized that it didn't have a sail or oars, not even a notch to rest them on. Almost as if it wasn't meant to be sailed at all, just pushed out to sea and…</p>
            <p>No. It couldn't possibly be a funeral barge. But he didn't know what else he could be looking at. It occurred to him that he probably shouldn't be touching it, but not until he had already grasped the side. His hand closed around flower petals, releasing a faintly sweet smell into the air. The raft creaked loudly as Hun tilted it towards himself, craning his neck to peek inside.</p>
            <p>Something cold brushed against his knuckles—another hand, pale and limp. Its fingers twitched against his.</p>
